<p align="center"><i>Minimal Emacs theme with pretty colors</i></p>

<pre>
Hima paints with colors few,
Bright and bold, they shine right through.
From code to mail, readers, too—
Emacs stays clean, fun, and true.
Workflow’s vibrant, calm, and new.

``` emacs-lisp
(use-package hima-theme
  :ensure t
  :config 
  (load-theme 'hima t))
```
